2013-2014. 

Java Project to predict the NBA winner by dynamically gathering and analysing data.

![Alt text](/src/nba-1.PNG?raw=true "Main Screen")

Uses SportsDataLLC/SportRadar API to dynamically grab the player data and produce predicted game information for each player,<br />
Exp, pTs, Ast, OR, TOV, FG%, FT%, 3PT%, 2PT%, DR, FIs, Blk, Stl.

Aggregating these values, game data is produced and then compared to predict a winner/loser. 

Not the most accurate. The API keys being used are for the free version and may not work anymore. Grab new ones from http://developer.sportradar.us/

The project also includes headshots for most of the NBA players.
